                    <h1><b>Biography</b></h1><br>
                    <h3>Early Years</h3>
                    <p>Sir M. V. was born to Srinivasa Sastry and Venkachamma at Muddenahalli village, Chikkaballapur
                        Taluk. Kolar District of present-day Karnataka, in what was then the princely state of Mysore.
                        His father Srinivasa Sastry was a Sanskrit scholar and an authority on the Hindu scriptures,
                        besides being an Ayurvedic practitioner. Sir M. V.'s ancestors actually hailed from the village
                        of Mokshagundam near Giddalur in the Prakasam District of present-day Andhra Pradesh; they had
                        migrated to Mysore state perhaps three centuries ago. The family name "Mokshagundam", preserves
                        the memory of his association with Andhra Pradesh.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The young Visvesvaraya lost his father at the age of 15. The family was resident at Kurnool of
                        Andhra Pradesh when this calamity befell them; they moved back to Muddenahalli thereafter. Sir
                        M. V. attended primary school at Chikkaballapur and high school at Bangalore. He earned his B.A.
                        from the Madras University in 1881 and later studied civil engineering at the College of
                        Science, Pune, now known as the College of Engineering, Pune (COEP). He was ranked first in the
                        L.C.E. and the F.C.E. Examinations in 1883.</p>
                    <h1><b>Career as Engineer</b></h1><br>
                    <p>Upon graduating as an engineer, Visvesvaraya took up a job with the Public Works Department (PWD)
                        of Bombay now known as Mumbai, and was later invited to join the Indian Irrigation Commission.
                        He implemented an extremely intricate system of irrigation in the Deccan area. He also designed
                        and patented a system of automatic weir water floodgates which were first installed in 1903 at
                        the Khadakyvasla reservoir near Pune, These gates were employed to raise the flood supply level
                        of storage in the reservoir to the highest level likely to be attained by its flood without
                        causing any damage to the dam. Based on the success of these gates, the same system was
                        installed at the Tigra dam in Gwalior and the Krishnaraja Sagara (KRS) dam in Mysore. He was the
                        brain behind the Krishnaraja Sagar dam in Mysore.</p><br>
                    <p>Visvesvaraya achieved celebrity status when he designed a flood protection system to protect the
                        city of Hyderabad from floods. He was also instrumental in developing a system to protect
                        Vishakapatnam, port from sea erosion.</p><br>
                    <p>Sir M. V. supervised the construction of the KRS dam across the Cauvery River from concept to
                        inauguration. This dam created the biggest reservoir in Asia at the time it was built. Sir MV
                        was rightly called the "Father of modern Mysore state" (now Karnataka): During his period of
                        service with the Government of Mysore state, he was responsible for founding of, under the aegis
                        of that government, the Mysore Soap Factor the Parasitoide laboratory, the Bhadravati Iron &
                        Steel Works, the Sri Jayachamarajendra Polytechnic Institute, the Bangalore Agricultural
                        University, the State Bank of Mysore. The Century Club, Mysore Chambers of Commerce and numerous
                        other industrial ventures. He also encouraged private investment in industry during his tenure
                        as Diwan of Mysore. He was known for sincerity, time management and dedication to a cause. He
                        was also instrumental in charting out the plan for road construction between Tirumala and
                        Tirupati.</p><br>
                    <p>Sir M.V. retired in 1908 and Sri Krishnarajendra Wodeyar, Maharaja of Mysore, was eager to secure
                        the services of Visvesvaraya to serve Mysore. He joined as Chief Engineer in Mysore because he
                        wanted challenging opportunities.</p>

                            <h1><b>As the Diwan Of Mysore</b></h1><br>
                            <p>After opting for voluntary retirement in 1908, Visvesvaraya was appointed Diwan or First
                                Minister of the princely state of Mysore, one of the largest and most important in
                                India. With the support of Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, Maharaja of Mysore. Visvesvaraya made
                                an arguably unprecedented contribution as Diwan to the all-round development of the
                                state. Not only the Krishnaraja Sagara dam and reservoir, the steel mills at
                                Bhadravathi, the Sri Jayachamarajendra Polytechnic Institute at Bangalore, the
                                University of Mysore, Karnataka Soaps & Detergents Limited (KSDL) - Govt Soap Factory
                                [1916] and many other industries and public works owe their inception or active
                                nurturing to him. He was instrumental in the founding of the "Government Engineering
                                College" at Bangalore in 1917, one of the first engineering institutes in India. This
                                institution was later named the "University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering" (UVCE)
                                after its founder. It remains one of the most reputed institutes of engineering in
                                Karnataka. Though he retired as Dewan of Mysore in 1918, he continued to work actively
                                even after his retirement.</p>
                            <h2>Very Simple Person</h2>
                            <p>He lead a very simple life. He was a strict vegetarian and a teetotaler. He would go to
                                sleep by 10 P.M. and wake up at 6 A.M. His diet included a very light breakfast, two
                                slices of bread or chappatis, vegetables without spices, rasam, curds, Nanjangud bananas
                                for lunch. He was known for his honesty and integrity. Before accepting the position of
                                Dewan of Mysore, he invited all his relatives for dinner. He told them very clearly that
                                he would accept the prestigious office on the condition that none of them would approach
                                him for favours. Such things are unheard of these days.</p><br>
                            <p>Sir M.V. had earned a reputation for his honesty, integrity, ability and intelligence. He
                                had introduced compulsory education in the State which later was embodied as a
                                fundamental right in the Constitution of independent India.</p><br>
                            <p>Sir M.V. belongs to that small band of eminent Indians whose ideas and achievements have
                                been among the truly creative and formative force of modern India. Sir M.V.'s slogan was
                                Industrialize or Perish and Mahatama Gandhiji's view was Industrialize and Perish. In
                                1921 Gandhiji launched his non-cooperation movement which Sir M.V. did not agree with.
                                Sir M.V. wrote to Gandhiji urging him to be dressed better in view of the upcoming Round
                                Table Conference. Sir M.V. used to be immaculately dressed.</p>

                            <p>Sir MV maintained an account with Bank of Mysore, which is now State Bank of Mysore. Sir

                                account had thrice attracted interests of Rs 14, Rs 66 and Rs 117 during this period. An
                                entry in the passbook on Nov 18, 1918 reveals he got Rs 13,486 transferred to this

                                mother discovered a stone that had an image carved into it. One day, when she was
                                returning home by a bullock cart, she noticed a stone lying in a field at the edge of
                                the road. A few days later, she found the stone still there. After several trips past
                                the stone, she stopped the bullock cart one day and asked the villagers who the stone
                                belonged to. The villagers did not know who thestone belonged to nor how it had got
                                there. The stone was taken to her house and she had a temple constructed which exists
                                to this day.</p>
